#Change Log
All changes to pythongenericserver will be documented in this file. 


## - 2016-5-27
- In _init_paths.py
	* added variable detectorversion = 1.000  vs. hard coding
	* added root path variable to avoid specifying in multiple files
	* added argparse statements to centralize location
	* added "topoutput" argparse such that top number of outputs from net can be 
	  specified on command line vs. hard coding
	  	[ex. python webapp.py --port 5000 --model murals --type CNN --topoutput 3]
	* added deleteQmessage variable for pullRequest functionality

- In webapp.py
	* added checks for s:// , www. , s: to redirect to http://
	* added timeout by setting timeout = 10 for response
	* removed argparse statements
	* added import _init_paths.py to remove explicit path for caffe-fast-rcnn/python
	* for pullrequest
			- added statements from not pull request to yield same functionality
			- avoided "working outside of request context" error by adding 
				with app.test_request_context():
			- added raise statement to exit pullrequest while loop 
			- post message using JSON 
			- post message with header for application/json (needs to be checked)
			- added if statement to post message to endpoint and delete from queue only if url is
				read correctly w/ detection present or not
			- added if statement to wait for message if queue is empty vs. breaking out
			- added if statement to enable SQS queue testing whether destinationUrl is specified or not
			- added threading.lock to prevent race condition of fetching multiple SQS message 
	* added multiple thread to run Flask server to serve multiple clients simultaneously
	* enable verify SSL certificate
	* added ability to read from local file

- In modelClass.py 
	* suppressed FutureWarning errors
	* turn on gpu mode for caffe in run_rcnnFaster
	* rcnn for porn model 

- In getSQSMessage.py
	* removed argparse statements / import webapp.py 

- In utility.py 
	* removed argparse statements / import webapp.py
	* json reformatted to adhere to convention set by LogoServer
		- confidence reported between 0-100
		- current json output is standardized; however, if mural_streetview is detected, json will be
		  outputted with brandID 1823 
		- from version1.0.0 reversed ImgH and ImgW 
	* moved all instances in which a json is created to call create_json() vs. building in different locations
		- heartbeat response - logs to heartbeat.log
		- couldn't open url - logs to results.log
		- image is size 0/NULL - no logs will be written
		- detections present - logs to results.log
		- if no detections are present - logs to result.log 
	* return None if get_image function is unable to get image vs. JSON (previously was written with redundant code)
	* updated json to newest convention
	* updated json to handle both RCNN and CNN 

- In preprocess.py
	* added ability for json_preprocessor (send an image to a different model and use the ROI from JSON as preprocessing step)
	

###- In convertmean.py
###	* added import _init_paths.py to remove explicit path for caffe-fast-rcnn/python

- Added logging functionality
	*logging.conf is the configuration file for logger module
	*results.log & heartbeat.log is current set to log in current directory; 
		can be changed to: 
				/var/log/vertex/pythongenericserver/results.log &
				/var/log/vertex/pythongenericserver/heartbeat.log


Notes: Models available
- Models for GumFace: 20160406-100928-9885_epoch_25.0.mural.tar.gz
- Models for Murals: 20160412-085835-5ee8_epoch_13.0.mural.tar.gz

TODO:
1) check if vertex mode satisfies all cases 
2) check if post has appropriate headers; couldn't see from requestb.in
3) should heartbeat be present for vertex mode? 
4) why is body empty in getSQSmessage sometimes? why would it go into that loop?

NOTE:
- this is only tested for -CNN , need to update for others.
